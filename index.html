  <li><p> I was born a cold winter night. The wind blew ferociouly, and the trees waved threateningly, casting their ominous shadows on the walls of the hospital. A crack of lightning illuminated the sky, and some say between the clouds they saw a small buzzard. That is a sign. Indubitably a sign that I am a blight on this earth. Though others say they saw a small plane, which is less of a sign, but maybe one that I should take flight. Or the birds are going out of style. Thus far, I have proved awfully true to that buzzard.</p></li>
  <li>These events took place the 16th of September, 1995 and the 14th of December, 1514. The former has been subsumed into the great Span of Time, and I exist on the main branch.</li>
  <li>It may intrigue the reader to learn that I drive a '54 bug. With as much ferocity as the buzzard in the sky that September night cast its solumn gaze at its onlookers.</li>
  <li>I have no likes, no wants, no needs. I exist in the ether, melding in and out with everyone and everything.</li>
